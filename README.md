-Branches can be extended from the Master Branch (i.e. currently working with readme-edits) 
-Make changes and commit to review branches 

-Pull requests are at 'heart of collaboration' on Github. When pull request: proposing MY (or someone else's...) changes and requesting someone PULL in my contribution and MERGE them into their branch. 
-Pull requests show 'diff's or differences of content from both branches.
